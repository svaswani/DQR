# Welcome to Death by QR!

Death by QR is an iOS app inspired by the popular group game known to some as
Death by Dagger, Assassin, Murder, etc., which is enjoyed by campers, college
students, and friends all over. DQR powers up this game of deception by
leveraging the power of QR codes, assigning each player an identity, a target,
and a predator. The objective of the game is to seek out and "assassinate" your
target by scanning thier QR code while simultaneously avoiding your own killer.
But, there's always a twist. You also earn points by <i>allowing</i> other
players to scan your identity, which sparks a battle of wits as you try to
smooth-talk and dodge your way to victory.
